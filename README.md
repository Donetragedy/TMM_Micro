# TMM_Micro

This software is designed for the optical characterization of thin films using microscope-based reflectometers.
To perform accurate simulations, it is necessary to input the objective lens geometry and the corresponding angular weights associated with the incident beam cone; these can be imported into the relevant section of the code.

Users can also import different material datasets and modify the layer structure by adding or removing layers as needed.
Thickness non-uniformity within the measurement area is included as a fitting parameter and is modeled using a Gaussian distribution.

All the files are in the Git folder.

Enjoy Physics!
