This software uses the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) for the optical characterization of thin films measured with a microscope-based reflectometer.

The main simulation script is named "TMM_FOR_MICRO".

Upon execution, the software prompts the user to select a measurement file. An example file, "2000nm_SiO2", corresponding to a 2000 nm SiOâ‚‚ sample, is included for demonstration purposes.

The package also includes three .xlsx files, which contain the refractive index data for the individual layers used in the simulation.
